## Computer Vision Practice with Python
This repository helps me keep track of my progress with learning computer vision and python

### K Nearest Neighbours
The K nearest neighbours algorithm keeps a copy of all the training data supplied and their corresponding labels. It classifies a new data by comparing it to the available data and matching it to the data with the smallest distance (smallest error).

#### Implementation
An algorithm was implemented for K=1.
Training was carried out using CIFAR-10 dataset.
Testing was performed with 2 random images from Google and 2 images from the test batch of CIFAR-10.
The algorithm successfully identified one of the samples images from CIFAR-10 test batch, it failed on the other three.
